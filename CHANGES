Changes in Version 8.1
----------------------

* Documentation now being hosted on wiki at:

    http://www.dscpl.com.au/wiki/Makeit

  Because of this change, the package was restructured so as to promote the
  actual software back up to the root of the package once again.

* The 'install' target now allows up to 9 directories for installation of
  auxiliary files. Ie., AUXDIR1, up to AUXDIR9.

* The AUXILIARIES variable can now reference files in subdirectories and
  the subdirectories will automatically be created. Thus:

    AUXDIR1 = /usr/local/include
    AUXILIARIES1 += */*.h

  Previously it was necessary to determine what the complete path to the
  subdirectories were and add them explicitly to the INSTALLDIRS variable.

* Try and determine where 'tsort' is installed as on platforms such as
  Solaris, people often do not have '/usr/ccs/bin' in their PATH.
