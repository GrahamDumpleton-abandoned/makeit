Changes in Version 8.1
----------------------

* Documentation now being hosted on wiki at:

    http://www.dscpl.com.au/wiki/Makeit

  Because of this change, the package was restructured so as to promote the
  actual software back up to the root of the package once again.

* The 'install' target now allows up to 9 directories for installation of
  auxiliary files. Ie., AUXDIR1, up to AUXDIR9.

* Try and determine where 'tsort' is installed as on platforms such as
  Solaris, people often do not have '/usr/ccs/bin' in their PATH.

* When specifying 'loadable_module' in PIC_OPTIONS and not also building a
  shared library, the 'pic' build directory wasn't being created on platform
  where normal object files aren't the same as position independent objects.

* Extraneous '%' character was being added to internal lists of files to be
  produced from generated C code and incorporated into the library. This
  was causing failure of the make rules. The problem manifested when using
  lex or yacc modules and option to incorporate generated code into the
  library was being used.

* Have yacc module add YACC_LDFLAGS to LDFLAGS if set. This can be need if
  bison is being used and its library isn't in a standard location.

* Have lex module add LEX_LDFLAGS to LDFLAGS if set. This can be need if
  flex is being used and its library isn't in a standard location.

* Fix issues with dependency generation when using yacc module which was
  resulting in code always being recompiled even when it didn't need to be.

* Move various pic variable definitions to global scope so that can be
  reused in other modules that want to explicitly trigger shared library
  or module creation.
