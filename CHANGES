Changes in Version 8.1
----------------------

* Documentation now being hosted on wiki at:

    http://www.dscpl.com.au/wiki/Makeit

  Because of this change, the package was restructured so as to promote the
  actual software back up to the root of the package once again.

* The 'install' target now allows up to 9 directories for installation of
  auxiliary files. Ie., AUXDIR1, up to AUXDIR9.

* Try and determine where 'tsort' is installed as on platforms such as
  Solaris, people often do not have '/usr/ccs/bin' in their PATH.

* When specifying 'loadable_module' in PIC_OPTIONS and not also building a
  shared library, the 'pic' build directory wasn't being created on platform
  where normal object files aren't the same as position independent objects.
