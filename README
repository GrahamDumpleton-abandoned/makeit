Makeit
======

Makeit is a build environment primarily targeted at developers using the C
and C++ programming languages.

Makeit relies on the freely available and widely portable `GNU make`_
program. GNU make provides a range of extensions to standard make
functionality far surpassing features available in commercial offerings.
Makeit builds on this functionality to provide a library of predefined
functionality which is included into your makefile and controlled through a
limited number of variables. Your makefiles remain simple as all those
rules you would otherwise have to write are out of sight. Further, all the
variations implicit in supporting different compilers and host operating
systems are also hidden, meaning not only will your makefile be simple, but
it will be portable.

Version 8.0 of makeit has more or less been rewritten from scratch and is
now being made available under a BSD style license_. You may install makeit
into a standard location and use it from there, or copy the package into a
subdirectory of your own project and use it from there instead.

Please note that in the process of rewriting makeit and arriving at version
8.0, it was restructured substantially in comparison to the version
supplied with OSE version 7.0. As such, various questionable features have
been dropped for the sake of simplicitly and the naming conventions
employed changed. Do not expect your existing makefiles to work without
some changes being required.

Any questions you may have should be directed to the "Help" web forum on
the OSE_ web site. Make it clear in your posts which version of this
package you are using.
