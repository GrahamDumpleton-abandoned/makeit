Makeit is in the process of being extracted out of OSE and made into a
seperate package in its own right. In the process of doing this, the
documentation is being updated and hosted here on this web site.

The version of makeit which is distributed with the beta versions of OSE
8.0 is effectively equivalent to what this web site documents. Until a
separate package for makeit is released, you can either obtain it from the
subversion repository, or use the version included with OSE 8.0.

Because of the changes in Makeit version 8.0, this documentation will not
always be relevant to older versions of Makeit. If you are using OSE 7.0,
you should consult the older documentation for Makeit on the OSE_ web site.
