Makeit is in the process of being extracted out of OSE and made into a
seperate package in its own right. The version of makeit in OSE 8.0 is
effectively equivalent to what this web site documents.

As this process of extraction is being done, the documentation is being
updated. Because of the changes in Makeit version 8.0, this documentation
will not always be relevant to older versions of Makeit.

If you are using OSE 7.0, you should consult the older documentation for
Makeit on the OSE_ web site.
